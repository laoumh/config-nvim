### Install Kickstart

Neovim's configurations are located under the following paths, depending on your OS:

| OS | PATH |
| :- | :--- |
| Linux, MacOS | `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/nvim`, `~/.config/nvim` |

#### Recommended Step

You likely want to remove `lazy-lock.json` from your fork's `.gitignore` file
too - it's ignored in the kickstart repo to make maintenance easier, but it's
[recommmended to track it in version control](https://lazy.folke.io/usage/lockfile).

#### Clone kickstart.nvim

```sh
git clone git@github.com:laoumh/kickstart.nvim.git "${$HOME/.config}"/nvim
```

### Post Installation

Start Neovim

```sh
nvim
```

That's it! Lazy will install all the plugins you have. Use `:Lazy` to view
current plugin status. Hit `q` to close the window.

Read through the `init.lua` file in your configuration folder for more
information about extending and exploring Neovim. That also includes
examples of adding popularly requested plugins.
